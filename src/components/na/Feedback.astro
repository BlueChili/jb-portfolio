                        With clear pain points and stakeholder requirements, it was easy to mock an <Em variant='dark'>MVP for the developers</Em> to start
                        building. Meanwhile the <Em variant='dark'>Alpha Group and I continued to explore features and refine solutions</Em>. And
                        finally, <Em variant='dark'>I put on my Design System hat and began culling Components and Patterns</Em> weâ€™d need to add to Lumen.
